# D&D Combat Simulator

The purpose of this project is to increase my understanding of D&D combat. Coding the mechanic sof the game will deepen my understanding. A secondary purpose is to understand the impact of various tactical options.

Building algorithms from Keith Ammans "Monsters know what they are doing" and "Live to tell the tale" will help me understand the essence of the factors that explain what is happening.
